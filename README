# My Docker Stuff

## Wordpress
You'll need a network created called "proxy" before running the Wordpress stack. This is so Traefik has a place to meet WP.

`docker network create -d overlay proxy`

You also need to deploy the Traefik stack before Wordpress will be accessible.

`docker stack deploy -c traefik.yml traefik`

`docker stack deploy -c wordpress.yml wordpress`
